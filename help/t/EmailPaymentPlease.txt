Hi,

Even though the service is just in alpha state, early subscriptions
are very important to me, especially for feedback.

To subscribe by going to:
https://baxx.dev/sub/{{ .Status.PaymentID }}

This will redirect you to paypal.com.

to check the terms of service you can go to:
https://baxx.dev/help/register/tos

Subscribing means you agree with it, so please
check it out.
(it pretty much says I am not liable for anything)

## Plan (only one for now):

Storage 10G
Trial 1 Month 0.1 EUR
Subscription: 5 EUR per Month
Availability: ALPHA

You can check the account status with:
