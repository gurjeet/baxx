  * cost
  2 machines, each running only docker and ssh
  each:
    64G ram, 2x512G ssd, 8cpu per machine
    40E to setup 
    40E per month
  so in total 80E once + 80E per month (VAT included)
  (which is almost the same to what I was paying on digital ocean)
  (10 + 15 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5) * 1.2 = 60
  lb + postgres + a.baxx.dev b.baxx.dev ui.baxx.dev notify.baxx.dev spaces + vat
  so 60E for 4gb ram 4 cpus and 250gb s3
  and this gave me 5cpus, 250G of s3 and 6gb ram

  anyway, current machines are running:
  
  [ bb.baxx.dev ]
  * ssh
  * docker
    + postgres-master
    + nginx + letsencrypt
    + who watches the watchers [ðŸ‘¹job]
    + run notification rules [ðŸ‘¹job]
    + process email queue [ðŸ‘¹job]
    + collect memory/disk/mdadam stats [privileged] [ðŸ‘¹job] (priv because mdadm)
    + baxx-api
    + judoc [localhost]
    + scylla [privileged] (priv because of io tunning)
  
  [ aa.baxx.dev ]
  * ssh
  * docker
    + postgres-slave
    + nginx + letsencrypt
    + who watches the watchers [ðŸ‘¹job]
    + process email queue [ðŸ‘¹job]
    + collect memory/disk/mdadam stats [privileged] [ðŸ‘¹job] (priv because mdadm)

  * money
  40tb for 250E per month means we an do 6E for 1TB
  it really depends on our customers, but we can assume some oversubscription and bet that people 
  will consume 200gb on average (which is still a lot considering they have to upload it on 1gbps),
  that means we can sell 40tb as 200tb, and then we can sell 1tb for 5E or make 
    1000E revenue - 250E hosting
    750E profit - 50% tax = 375E profit
  if we manage to find 200 customers haha
  
  with this price we will be 50% of dropbox's price
  
  * market segments
   backup landscape:
      + github free private repos
      + most managed databases have automatic backups
      + most cms hostings have their backup
      + enormous amount of choice
      + digital ocean, s3 - cheap cloud
      even though our service is mainly about the api and notifications,
      it is unlikely anyone using the existing solutions will switch
      regardless how cheap or better it is
      
   segment we are interested in:
     + people having to maintain few old boxes and back them up
       (like me)
     + data hoarders, since our price is half of dropbox we are attractive
     + unix geeks, that just want to curl their stuff and write scripts using it
    
     lets hope there are 200 of those people in the world
     
   * how can we get 200 customers for a product without a website
     no idea, but start with reddit :D
